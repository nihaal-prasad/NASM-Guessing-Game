# NASM-Guessing-Game
This is a guessing game that I coded in assembly using the NASM assembler. I also use some of the libraries from my NASM-libraries repository in order to code this a little bit faster (I also included the code that I used from those libraries in this repository, so you don't have to copy and paste them).

## Usage
Using this program is quite simple. Just assemble the code using NASM and run it.
